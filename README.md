# Spearman_Correlation_Index
Calculation of the **Spearman's Rank Correlation Index** by RStudio

### Objective
For this project, we intended to find the correlation between the most relatively abundant genera and the main metabolic pathways predicted by metagenomics. 

### Samples
The samples were obtained from spent nuclear fuel storage ponds. Details will be completed when the publication is released. 

### Method
The correlation analysis between the most relatively abundant genera and the relative abundance of metabolic pathways was performed using Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient, and significance was established at p < 0.05
